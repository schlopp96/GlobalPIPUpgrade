# Total PIP-Package Upgrade

- This is a small powershell script that will allow the user to upgrade _all_ pip packages at once.

## Usage

- Simply run the script using powershell, and press "1" when prompted, then press the [ENTER] key to confirm your choice.
  - From here, the upgrading process will continue on its own until its completion, where it will close the console window on its own.
