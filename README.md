# Total PIP-Package Upgrade

- This is a small powershell script that will allow the user to upgrade _all_ pip packages at once.

---

## Usage

1. Run the script using powershell.
2. Press "`1`" then the "`[ENTER]`" key to begin update process, or enter anything else to exit.

- From here, the upgrading process will continue on its own until its completion, where it will close the console window on its own.
